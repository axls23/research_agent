Dust grains in the disk\nmake rocky planets and the cores of gas giants, while the\nforming planets may accrete their atmospheres directly\nfrom the disk's gas content or when the grains' ice man-\ntles sublimate. Therefore, studying the composition of\nprotoplanetary disks is needed to understand the initial\nmineralogical and chemical composition that the youngplanets inherit (e.g., J\u001crgensen et al. 2020; Eistrup &\nHenning 2022; Wordsworth & Kreidberg 2022).\nInfrared spectroscopy is an excellent tool to in-\nvestigate the warm material in protoplanetary disks.\nThe small, amorphous silicate grains that the disks\nof T Tauri stars inherit from the interstellar medium\nhave prominent broad features around 9 :7\u0016m due to\nthe Si{O stretching modes and around 18 \u0016m due to\nO{Si{O bending modes (Henning 2010). During theirarXiv:2301.08770v2  [astro-ph.SR]  25 Jan 2023\n2 K\u0013osp\u0013al et al.\nevolution, these silicates may undergo thermal pro-\ncessing and form crystalline silicates such as forsterite\nand enstatite, which have multiple narrow features at\ninfrared wavelengths (e.g. Fabian et al. 2001). The\ninfrared regime is rich in rotational and rovibrational\nlines of gas-phase molecules and broad bands of molec-\nular ices. These have been extensively studied using\nspace missions like the Infrared Space Observatory (e.g.,\nvan Dishoeck 2004, and references therein), the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope (e.g., Boogert et al. 2008; Pontoppi-\ndan et al. 2010), the Herschel Space Observatory (e.g.,\nFedele et al. 2013; Dent et al. 2013), and now the JWST.\nWhile circumstellar disks typically evolve on 105\u0000\n106yr time scales (Williams & Cieza 2011), variable\nheating and changing irradiation during accretion bursts\nand outbursts may change them signi\fcantly faster (Fis-\ncher et al. 2022). Due to the released energy, outbursts\ncan have signi\fcant e\u000bects on the disk material, mod-\nifying its physical, chemical, and mineralogical proper-\nties (Molyarova et al. 2018; \u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. 2019). As\neruptions overlap with the earliest stages of planet for-\nmation, episodic accretion may have far-reaching con-\nsequences for disk evolution and planet formation (e.g.,\nCieza et al. 2016).\nThe best studied example for accretion outburst in-\nduced changes is EX Lup, the prototype of the EXor\nclass of young eruptive stars (Herbig 1989). In 2008,\nEX Lup exhibited its largest outburst ever observed\n(\u0001V\u00185 mag). A multi-wavelength, multi-epoch investi-\ngation of this event revealed the annealing of amorphous\nsilicates to crystalline grains, detected via their 10 and\n11.3\u0016m emission ( \u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. 2009). In parallel,\nBanzatti et al. (2012, 2015) reported increased strength\nfor OH and H 2O lines during the outburst, while organ-\nics, such as C 2H2and HCN, disappeared, possibly due\nto UV photodissociation.\nIn the course of the year following the outburst,\nthe spectral signatures of the crystalline grains at 10\nand 11.3\u0016m gradually weakened and later disappeared\n(\u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. 2019). During the 2008 outburst, cold\nforsterite emission also appeared between 15{35 \u0016m,\nwhich became even stronger after the end of the outburst\nin late 2008 - early 2009. As these long wavelength fea-\ntures were not present before the outburst, Juh\u0013 asz et al.\n(2012) proposed that the crystals formed in the inner\ndisk and were transported to outer disk regions driven\nby a low velocity wind. Based on this idea, \u0013Abrah\u0013 am\net al. (2019) performed radiative transfer modeling of\nmulti-epoch mid-infrared spectra. They predicted that\nthe crystalline grains cooled down and are now located\nat\u00153 au from the central star, but could be as far as\n\u001810 au (with an expansion velocity of \u00183 km s\u00001). If theforsterite grains can reach the water snowline at 3.5 au\non the disk surface ( \u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. 2009), they may\nbring crystalline material to newly forming planetesi-\nmals and reveal the details of the radial transport pro-\ncesses in the disk. After Spitzer but before JWST, we\nlacked the sensitivity and wavelength coverage to detect\nthese cold crystals.\nApart from smaller bursts in 2011 and early 2022\n(\u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. 2019; Zhou & Herczeg 2022; K\u0013 osp\u0013 al\net al. 2022), EX Lup has been in quiescence since 2008.\nWhile it may currently be similar to a typical, quiescent\nT Tauri disk, it also o\u000bers an opportunity to study possi-\nble residual e\u000bects from the 2008 large outburst. To sur-\nvey the mid-infrared spectral features in EX Lup's disk,\nwe observed it with the medium-resolution spectrome-\nter (MRS) of JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI).\nHere, we present our \frst results based on this spectrum.\n2.OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\nWe obtained JWST/MIRI MRS spectroscopy of\nEX Lup on 2022 August 23 (GO 2209, PI: P. \u0013Abrah\u0013 am).\nWe used all four channels and all three sub-bands,\ncovering 4.9{28 \u0016m at a spectral resolution of 3500{\n1500. We observed a separate background 193 :005 away\nfrom EX Lup, centered at RA J2000 = 16h03m12:s63,\nDEC J2000 =\u000040\u000e15030:0042. Exposure time was 344.1 s\nfor the science target and 41.6 s for the background.\nWe used the FASTR1 readout mode and 4-point dither-\ning for EX Lup and no dithering for the background.\nWe reduced the spectra by running the JWST pipeline\nversion 1.8.2. Dedicated background exposures were\nsubtracted on the exposure level to remove the thermal\nbackground. We further applied a residual fringe correc-\ntion based on the empirical sine model \ftting method\ndescribed in, e.g., Kester et al. (2003) and Kavanagh\net al. (in prep.). The correction \fts and removes fringe\nresiduals that are assumed to be low in amplitude after\napplication of the fringe \rat correction in the pipeline.\nThe spacecraft pointing information was about 1 :002\no\u000bset from the actual pointing inferred from both the\nMIRI integral \feld data and MIRI simultaneous images.\nDue to this, EX Lup was not well centered in the MRS\n\feld of view; a signi\fcant part of the source was cut\no\u000b in two of the four dither positions observed in the\nshort wavelength channels, where the \feld of view was\nthe smallest. We discarded the a\u000bected dithers when\nconstructing the spectral cubes for channels 1 and 2.\nTo check whether JWST spatially resolved the mid-\ninfrared emission of EX Lup, we compared the 3D data\ncubes with similar measurements of a point source tem-\nplate. We used 10 Lac, observed within the calibration\nprogram 1524 (PI: D.R. Law) with the purpose of char-\nJWST/MIRI Spectroscopy of EX Lup 3\nFigure 1. JWST/MIRI MRS spectrum of EX Lup (color), shown together with an earlier Spitzer/IRS spectrum (gray), both\ntaken in quiescence. The di\u000berent colors mark the individual sub-bands of the JWST spectrum. We indicated some of the\nobserved molecular and solid state features. We note that the spectrum contains hundreds of H 2O lines; we only marked a few\nof them as an illustration. The JWST spectrum shown here is available as Data behind the Figure.\nacterizing the point spread function of MIRI MRS. Af-\nter rotating, shifting, scaling, and subtracting the 10 Lac\nmeasurements from the EX Lup measurements channel\nby channel, we found that the residuals were typically\nbelow a few %. A comparison between 2D Gaussian\nsizes \ftted to EX Lup and 10 Lac did not reveal any sig-\nni\fcant di\u000berence in the 4 :9\u000026:5\u0016m range. At longer\nwavelengths, 10 Lac was too faint to be detected reliably.\nThus, EX Lup remained unresolved by MIRI.\nWe calculated the centroid for each image in the 3D\ndata cube and used aperture photometry to extract the\n1D spectrum using the default parameters for point\nsources. Flux levels of di\u000berent channels and sub-bands\n(for the usable dither positions) were in general consis-\ntent within 5% in the overlapping wavelength ranges.\nOne exception is the channel 4 medium sub-band (20.8{\n24.3\u0016m), which was lower by 10%. We corrected these\nmismatches by applying multiplicative factors deter-\nmined in the overlapping regions. No scaling was applied\nto channel 2 (7.6{11.7 \u0016m). The observed shifts between\nthe spectral channels are consistent with the quoted 10%\nabsolute \rux calibration uncertainty determined during\nthe commissioning of the MRS instrument.1To the best\nof our knowledge, the only remaining instrumental arti-\nfact is the dip around 12.25 \u0016m due to a spectral leak.\nTo check the accuracy of the wavelength calibration\nof our spectrum, we measured the wavelengths of 139\nstrong non-blended water emission lines (section 3) and\n1https://www.stsci.edu/\fles/live/sites/www/\fles/home/jwst/\ndocumentation/ documents/jwst-science-performance-report.pdfcomputed the shifts compared to the theoretical wave-\nlengths. According to the documentation, the wave-\nlength calibration of MIRI MRS is accurate to within\n1 spectral resolution element (85{200 km s\u00001depending\non channel and sub-band). We found that the measured\nshifts are less than 0.0015 \u0016m below 10 \u0016m and less than\n0.003\u0016m above 10 \u0016m, much better than the nominal\naccuracy.\nThe \fnal spectrum is plotted in Figure 1. As repre-\nsentative values, we reached signal-to-noise ratios (S/N)\nof 120 at 9.0 \u0016m, 100 at 15.5 \u0016m, and 60 at 25.0 \u0016m on\nthe continuum.\n3.RESULTS AND ANALYSES\n3.1. Spectral Energy Distribution\nThe MIRI MRS spectrum of EX Lup, plotted in F\u0017,\nslowly rises towards longer wavelengths between 4.9{\n8\u0016m, after which a prominent 10 \u0016m silicate emission\nfeature is visible. Above 13 \u0016m, the spectrum increases\nagain until \u001818\u0016m, where a shallow, broad 18 \u0016m sil-\nicate feature begins. Apart from some weaker, nar-\nrower silicate features between 18{24 \u0016m the spectrum\nis approximately \rat here, then slowly decreases toward\nlonger wavelengths.\nAt the date of the MIRI observation (2022 August),\nEX Lup was in quiescence following a medium-size burst\noccurring between 2022 February{April (Cruz-S\u0013 aenz de\nMiera et al. in prep.). Thus, we compared the spectral\nshape with an earlier quiescent spectrum obtained with\nSpitzer/IRS in 2005 March (Figure 1; Sipos et al. 2009;\n\u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. 2009). The two spectra have similar\n4 K\u0013osp\u0013al et al.\nFigure 2. Continuum-subtracted JWST/MIRI spectrum of EX Lup with various dust models, and with the Spitzer/IRS\nquiescent spectrum from 2005. The model curves were shifted for clarity.\nshapes with slight di\u000berences. The \rux levels are the\nsame at 5\u0016m, but the JWST spectrum has a shallower\nslope at 5{8 \u0016m. Between 8{18 \u0016m, the two spectra have\npractically identical shapes, but JWST measured 12%\nlower \rux than Spitzer. Above 18 \u0016m, the two spec-\ntra again have slightly di\u000berent slopes: the earlier one\nis \rat, the newer one decreases towards longer wave-\nlengths. We also compared the JWST spectrum with the\naverage of four ISOPHOT/PHOT-S spectra obtained in\n1997 February-September (K\u0013 osp\u0013 al et al. 2012) and found\nthat in the overlapping wavelength range (5.8{11.6 \u0016m)\nthey are consistent with MIRI within the uncertainties.\nThese results demonstrate that the MIRI spectrum rep-\nresents well the quiescent state of EX Lup.\n3.2. Dust Features\nThe characteristic strong, triangular shape of the\n10\u0016m silicate emission feature in the 2005 Spitzer spec-\ntrum (Figure 2) was interpreted by \u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al.\n(2009) as the signature of amorphous sub-micron-sized\ngrains. Sipos et al. (2009) \ftted this pro\fle and found\nthat the mass fraction of crystalline silicates was <2%.\nSince the 10 \u0016m feature in our MIRI spectrum has a very\nsimilar shape to the Spitzer/IRS, we conclude that the\ndisk of EX Lup contained only small amounts of warm\nforsterite or enstatite in 2022 August.\nIn Figure 2 we compared our JWST spectrum with\nthe 10\u0016m emission pro\fle of amorphous dust grains\nusing the opacity curves of olivine and pyroxene type\nsilicates. We derived dust opacities using the OPACI-\nTYTOOL software (Toon & Ackerman 1981; Min et al.\n2005; Woitke et al. 2016), which is based on the distribu-tion of hollow spheres (DHS) theory (Min et al. 2005).\nWe took the complex refractive index for amorphous sil-\nicate from the literature (Dorschner et al. 1995). Follow-\ning Sipos et al. (2009), we used 0.1 \u0016m-sized olivines and\n1.5\u0016m-sized pyroxenes with a ratio of 2:1. After contin-\nuum subtraction, the measured spectral shape can be\nwell reproduced by adopting T\u00191200 K for the under-\nlying blackbody emission, but higher temperatures up\nto 1500 K give similarly good results.\nAt longer wavelengths the MIRI spectrum exhibits\nseveral narrower emission peaks at 16.3, 19.0, 20.0, and\n23.5\u0016m. To check if they originate from crystalline sil-\nicates, we compared our spectrum with opacity curves\nof forsterite grains (Servoin & Piriou 1973). In Figure 2\nwe plotted the infrared spectrum of small 0.1 \u0016m (green)\nand larger 2.7 \u0016m (pink) forsterite crystalline grains. We\nmultiplied the opacities by a blackbody curve of 150 K\nto represent a cold dust population. We found that the\nsmall forsterite grains could be responsible for the fea-\ntures peaking around 16.3, 19.0, and 23.5 \u0016m. The ad-\nditional presence of larger forsterite grains may explain\nthe feature at 20.0 \u0016m.\nAs our model in Figure 2 shows, small forsterite grains\nalso have an emission peak at 11.3 \u0016m, whose strength\ndepends strongly on the temperature. This feature is\nnot detected in the observed JWST spectrum. Tests\nwith various dust temperatures show that it would be\nvisible for \u0015175 K. In conclusion, the dust composition\nin the EX Lup disk is dominated by warm (T \u00151200 K)\namorphous grains, but a colder (T \u0014150 K) crystalline\nsilicate, probably forsterite, component is also present.\nJWST/MIRI Spectroscopy of EX Lup 5\n3.3. Gas features\nThe MIRI spectrum of EX Lup also includes a for-\nest of gas emission lines from molecules previously ob-\nserved in T Tauri disks (Carr & Najita 2008, 2011; Bit-\nner et al. 2008; Lahuis et al. 2007): H 2O, OH, H 2, HCN,\nC2H2, and CO 2. These molecules were identi\fed in\nEX Lup either during its quiescent phase in 2005 or dur-\ning outburst in 2008 using Spitzer/IRS. Line strengths\nstrongly changed between the two epochs, with organics\ndisappearing from the spectrum and stronger OH lines,\nsuggesting e\u000bects from UV photodissociation (Banzatti\net al. 2012). Additionally, CO ro-vibrational lines in the\nfundamental band were previously observed in EX Lup\nduring outburst in 2008 (Goto et al. 2011) and dur-\ning quiescence in 2014 (Banzatti et al. 2015) using\nVLT/CRIRES. These data suggested the presence of hot\nmolecular gas in the inner disk during outburst.\nThe new MIRI data show the 4.9{27 \u0016m mid-infrared\nspectrum of EX Lup for the \frst time since 2008, cov-\nering all of the above mentioned molecular lines at high\nresolution, allowing us to study longer-term chemical\nchanges induced by an accretion outburst. In this \frst\npaper, we only provide a brief overview of the most\nprominent lines observed in the spectrum and illustrate\nthe approximate match to slab models. The in-depth\nanalysis of the molecular emission is left to an upcom-\ning paper.\nFor line identi\fcation, we produced synthetic spectra\nusing a slab model in local thermodynamic equilibrium\nfollowing Banzatti et al. (2012), with molecular data\nfrom the latest HITRAN release (Gordon et al. 2022).\nWe adopted parameters from previous works and ad-\njusted them by eye to match the relative strength of\ngas emission lines in the MIRI data. Figure 3 displays\nportions of the continuum-subtracted spectrum show-\ning all the major molecules observed. Hundreds of H 2O\nlines are detected from ro-vibrational bands below 8 \u0016m\nand from pure rotational transitions between 12{28 \u0016m.\nCompared to previous Spitzer spectra, most of these\nlines are now de-blended in the MIRI spectrum, with\nsome blending still visible at the shortest wavelengths.\nIn Figure 3, we show two slab models for water using\nproperties previously found from \fts to high-resolution\nground-based spectra of other T Tauri disks (Banzatti\net al. 2022a): T\u00181000 K for the ro-vibrational lines\nbelow 6.6\u0016m andT\u0018600 K for the rotational lines\nat 13{16\u0016m, and a similar column density of \u00191017{\n1018cm\u00002.\nFor CO we adopted properties found previously in\nhigh-resolution spectra that covered lines up to J=\n50 (Banzatti et al. 2022b): T\u0018800 K and NCO\u0018\n1019cm\u00002. Since MIRI has insu\u000ecient resolution todistinguish the broad (BC) and narrow (NC) velocity\ncomponents observed in ground-based data, we adopted\nhereTandNin between those estimated for BC and NC\nin other disks (see Figure 11 in Banzatti et al. 2022b).\nThe relative weakness of the v= 2\u00001 lines suggests\nsub-thermal vibrational excitation, so we used a lower\nvibrational temperature Tvib\u0018450 K.\nDetection of ro-vibrational emission from C 2H2, HCN,\nand CO 2demonstrates that the organic molecules are\nback after disappearing during the 2008 outburst. The\nQ-branch emission lines (near 13.7 \u0016m, 14.0\u0016m, and\n14.9\u0016m respectively) are still blended at the resolution\nof MIRI, but several weak lines are now detected for the\n\frst time from the P and R branches. For HCN, multiple\npeaks in the Q branch are distinguished with MIRI. The\nslab models in Figure 3 assumed T\u0018300\u0000800 K and\ncolumn density of \u00191015{1016cm\u00002as found from pre-\nvious analyses of Spitzer spectra of T Tauri disks (Carr\n& Najita 2011; Salyk et al. 2011).\nMultiple weak lines from OH are detected through-\nout the spectrum. Mid-infrared OH emission has pre-\nviously shown very high temperatures indicative of pro-\nduction from UV photodissociation of water (Carr &\nNajita 2014), and was found to increase during the 2008\noutburst in EX Lup (Banzatti et al. 2012). In Figure 3,\nwe useT\u00184000 K and N\u00181016cm\u00002.\nSeveral rotational lines of molecular hydrogen (H 2)\nare detected from 0{0 S(8) at 5.05 \u0016m to 0{0 S(1) at\n17.03\u0016m (Roue\u000b et al. 2019). Some of the lines are\nblended with CO or H 2O, but S(1), S(3), S(4), S(5),\nand S(7) are well resolved.\nLines of longer chain hydrocarbons (C 2H4at 10.5\u0016m)\nor aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, C 6H6, at 5.1 and\n5.5\u0016m) were not found. We also searched for CH 3OH\n(9.7\u0016m), CH 4(7.6\u0016m), NH 3(10.1{10.9\u0016m), and H 2CO\n(5.7\u0016m), but found no such lines in the MIRI spectrum\nof EX Lup at this stage of the data reduction and anal-\nysis.\n4.DISCUSSION\n4.1. Quiescent Disk Variability\nIn quiescence, EXors have accretion rates similar to\nregular T Tauri stars (Lorenzetti et al. 2012), therefore\ntheir disks should also be similar to those of normal\nT Tauri disks. Indeed, the MIRI spectrum of EX Lup\nis similar to typical T Tauri disk spectra (e.g., Furlan\net al. 2006; Kessler-Silacci et al. 2006). Sipos et al.\n(2009) studied the quiescent spectral energy distribu-\ntion (SED) of EX Lup and found that its shape is very\nsimilar to the median SED of T Tauri stars in the Tau-\nrus star-forming region. Interestingly, their radiative\ntransfer modeling revealed that the dust disk of EX Lup\n6 K\u0013osp\u0013al et al.\nFigure 3. Continuum-subtracted MIRI spectrum with slab models for the identi\fcation of molecular lines.\ndoes not extend inward until the dust sublimation ra-\ndius (0.06 au), but it has a larger inner radius at about\n0.2{0.3 au.\nWhile the general shape of the 5{27 \u0016m spectrum of\nEX Lup is very similar between 2005 (Spitzer) and 2022\n(JWST), the object was somewhat ( <25%) fainter in\n2022. Such small infrared variability is not unusual\nfor EX Lup in quiescence, because multiple quiescent\nSpitzer spectra (2004 August, 2005 March, and 2009\nApril) also show di\u000berences up to 20%. A comparison\nof Spitzer and ISO spectra of EX Lup by K\u0013 osp\u0013 al et al.\n(2012) also revealed only minor changes.\nInterestingly, the slope of the SED in the 5{8 \u0016m\nand 24{27\u0016m ranges as measured by JWST is di\u000ber-\nent from those in 2005. Such variations of the infrared\nspectral slope, and in certain cases, anti-correlation be-\ntween shorter and longer mid-infrared wavelengths with\na pivot point in-between was noticed in other young\nstars and has been explained with variable inner rim\nheight and variable shadowing of the outer disk (Muze-\nrolle et al. 2009; Flaherty et al. 2011; Espaillat et al.\n2011; K\u0013 osp\u0013 al et al. 2012). In EX Lup, the shallower\nslope at shorter wavelengths may indicate more warm\nmaterial or a larger scale height around the inner edge\nof the dust disk. The radius of the inner edge might also\nhave changed between the two epochs. The decreasing\nslope at longer wavelengths as opposed to the earlier \ratSED may point to the possibility that the outer part of\nthe disk received less illumination in 2022 than in 2005.\n4.2. Silicate Crystals Towards the Snowline\nIn subsection 3.2 we showed that the pro\fle of the\n10\u0016m silicate feature in our JWST spectrum is very\nsimilar to that observed with Spitzer/IRS in 2005, prior\nto the large outburst. Thus, JWST con\frmed that the\ncrystalline forsterite grains, produced in 2008 through\nthermal annealing on the disk surface between 0.3 and\n0.7 au and detected via their 10 and 11.3 \u0016m emission\nby\u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. (2009, 2019), are not present in the\ninner disk any more. This result is consistent with\nVLTI/MIDI data from 2013 and VLT/VISIR data from\n2016, which also failed to detect the crystalline features\nat 10 and 11.3 \u0016m, although at lower signi\fcance level\n(\u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. 2019).\nThe hypothesis of Juh\u0013 asz et al. (2012) and \u0013Abrah\u0013 am\net al. (2019), that the forsterite grains formed in 2008\nstill exist but were transported to outer colder disk re-\ngions (section 1), could not be veri\fed after the end of\nthe cryogenic mission of Spitzer (May 2009) until now.\nThe unambiguous detection of cold crystalline features\nin the 16{26 \u0016m range of the JWST/MIRI spectrum,\nhowever, implies that we very likely re-discovered the\nforsterite grains that were inaccessible for the available\ninstrumentation for more than a decade.\nJWST/MIRI Spectroscopy of EX Lup 7\nFigure 4. Left: continuum subtracted JWST/MIRI spectrum of EX Lup (black) and model spectra including an amorphous\ndisk and a hollow crystalline sphere placed at di\u000berent radii (red). Right: density distributions of the various models (in g cm\u00003).\nModels are from \fg. 2 of \u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. (2019).\nTo infer the radial location of the cold crystals, we\ncompared the measured crystalline pro\fles with syn-\nthetic spectra computed by \u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. (2019) for\na model containing a disk made of amorphous dust\ngrains and an expanding hollow sphere made of crys-\ntalline forsterite, assuming three di\u000berent radii for the\nsphere: 3 au, 5 au, and 9.68 au. Figure 4 presents this\ncomparison. The strength of the 23.5 \u0016m band suggests\nthat our JWST measurement is most consistent with a\nradial distance of \u00183 au for the current location of the\ncrystalline material.\nThe derived radial distance of \u00183 au suggests that the\ncrystalline grains formed in 2008 may now be in the\nvicinity of the water snowline: a disk region where the\ntemperature drops to 150{170 K and water molecules\nfreeze out onto grain surfaces (at 3.5 au on the surface\nof EX Lup's disk). The temperature of \u0014150 K, esti-\nmated for the crystalline dust in subsection 3.2, is fully\nconsistent with this conclusion. We have very limited\ninformation on the spatial distribution of the crystals.\nTheir geometry is probably determined by the proper-\nties of the wind that provides the momentum for the\ntransportation of the grains.\n\u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. (2019) proposed that the crystals were\nat 3 au already in 2013. As the current JWST spec-\ntrum indicates that the crystalline grains are still at 3 au,\ntheir radial expansion might have slowed down. Thus,\nthey are not expected to move signi\fcantly further away\nfrom the star in the future. However, they may not stay\nundisturbed in their current location either. In 1955/56\nEX Lup underwent a large outburst, similar to the one\nin 2008 (Herbig 1977), and it is reasonable to assumethat a comparable amount of crystalline silicates was\nthen produced. Those grains could have also moved\noutward, but the Spitzer spectrum in 2005 exhibited\nno cold forsterite emission (Figure 2), suggesting that\nsomething happened with the cooled-down crystalline\ngrains on decadal timescales.\nVertical mixing in the disk could remove the crystals\nfrom the surface. Fig. 6 in the Supplementary Material\nof\u0013Abrah\u0013 am et al. (2009) shows that at a radial distance\nof 3 au, a turbulent viscosity parameter \u000bof a few times\n10\u00002gives a vertical mixing timescale of \u001450 yr. Alter-\nnatively, crystalline particles may start growing ice man-\ntles as they move outward, leading to the non-detection\nof well-de\fned mid-infrared spectral features due to the\nincreased grain size. Using Eqn. 12 from Rab et al.\n(2017), and adopting representative parameters for the\nEX Lup disk at 3 au close to the vertical water ice line,\nwe obtain a freeze-out timescale of about 3 yr. Based\non these considerations, we anticipate changes in the\nstrength of the crystalline spectral features during the\nnext years/decades in EX Lup. Future monitoring with\nJWST will be invaluable to follow this evolution.\nWhen the crystalline grains reach the snowline, they\nmay acquire ice mantles, and the increased collisional\ncross section and stickiness would facilitate future incor-\nporation into planetesimals, including icy protocomets.\nIf all the crystalline grains produced in the 2008 out-\nburst end up in the water snowline region, that would\nadd\u00181.9\u00021023g (equal to 104times the mass of comet\nHale{Bopp) to the crystalline dust reservoir ( \u0013Abrah\u0013 am\net al. 2019). If similar large outbursts occur in every\n50 years for an extended period of 105years, the total\n8 K\u0013osp\u0013al et al.\nyield would be 2 \u000210\u00007M\f. Based on these numbers,\nwe propose that large eruptions of young stars may be\na signi\fcant source of crystalline grains in planetesimals\nand ultimately in the planet-building material.\n4.3. Future prospects\nThe MIRI spectrum in 2022 provides the \frst oppor-\ntunity to study mid-infrared molecular lines since the\n2008 outburst. The organic molecules that disappeared\nin 2008 are now detected again. Modeling of these (and\nother) lines in the JWST spectrum and a detailed study\nof their time variability will be the topic of a future pa-\nper (Diehl et al. in prep.). The increased spectral resolu-\ntion of JWST/MIRI MRS (as compared to Spitzer/IRS)\nand the high S/N of the spectrum will allow us to\nde-blend and \ft the various molecules, providing more\nstringent constraints than ever before on the thermal\nstructure and molecular abundances in EX Lup's disk.\nWe demonstrated that the spectrum also provides an un-\nprecedentedly rich information on various silicate com-\nponents and their temperature distribution, allowing the\ncharacterization of the planet and comet forming solids.\nRe-observing EX Lup with the JWST will provide a\nunique opportunity to monitor long-term chemical andmineralogical changes in the disk due to the variable\naccretion.\nWe thank the reviewer for useful comments that\nhelped to improve the manuscript.
